# Upload enrolment methods #

Upload enrolment methods from a CSV file into a range of courses

## Description ##

The Upload course enrolment methods plugin for Moodle allows you to add enrolment methods to a range of courses at the same time.
The Course meta link and Cohort sync methods are supported.
You can also delete, enable or disable existing enrolment methods in a course.
The plugin is strongly based on the [Upload Metacourse links (block_metalink)](https://moodle.org/plugins/block_metalink)
